 * vacuumlazy.c
 *	  Concurrent ("lazy") vacuuming.
 *
 * The major space usage for vacuuming is storage for the array of dead TIDs
 * that are to be removed from indexes.  We want to ensure we can vacuum even
 * the very largest relations with finite memory space usage.  To do that, we
 * set upper bounds on the number of TIDs we can keep track of at once.
 *
 * We are willing to use at most maintenance_work_mem (or perhaps
 * autovacuum_work_mem) memory space to keep track of dead TIDs.  We initially
 * allocate an array of TIDs of that size, with an upper limit that depends on
 * table size (this limit ensures we don't allocate a huge area uselessly for
 * vacuuming small tables).  If the array threatens to overflow, we must call
 * lazy_vacuum to vacuum indexes (and to vacuum the pages that we've pruned).
 * This frees up the memory space dedicated to storing dead TIDs.
 *
 * In practice VACUUM will often complete its initial pass over the target
 * heap relation without ever running out of space to store TIDs.  This means
 * that there only needs to be one call to lazy_vacuum, after the initial pass
 * completes.

/*
 *	lazy_scan_heap() -- workhorse function for VACUUM
 *
 *		This routine prunes each page in the heap, and considers the need to
 *		freeze remaining tuples with storage (not including pages that can be
 *		skipped using the visibility map).  Also performs related maintenance
 *		of the FSM and visibility map.  These steps all take place during an
 *		initial pass over the target heap relation.
 *
 *		Also invokes lazy_vacuum_all_indexes to vacuum indexes, which largely
 *		consists of deleting index tuples that point to LP_DEAD items left in
 *		heap pages following pruning.  Earlier initial pass over the heap will
 *		have collected the TIDs whose index tuples need to be removed.
 *
 *		Finally, invokes lazy_vacuum_heap_rel to vacuum heap pages, which
 *		largely consists of marking LP_DEAD items (from collected TID array)
 *		as LP_UNUSED.  This has to happen in a second, final pass over the
 *		heap, to preserve a basic invariant that all index AMs rely on: no
 *		extant index tuple can ever be allowed to contain a TID that points to
 *		an LP_UNUSED line pointer in the heap.  We must disallow premature
 *		recycling of line pointers to avoid index scans that get confused
 *		about which TID points to which tuple immediately after recycling.
 *		(Actually, this isn't a concern when target heap relation happens to
 *		have no indexes, which allows us to safely apply the one-pass strategy
 *		as an optimization).
 *
 *		In practice we often have enough space to fit all TIDs, and so won't
 *		need to call lazy_vacuum more than once, after our initial pass over
 *		the heap has totally finished.  Otherwise things are slightly more
 *		complicated: our "initial pass" over the heap applies only to those
 *		pages that were pruned before we needed to call lazy_vacuum, and our
 *		"final pass" over the heap only vacuums these same heap pages.
 *		However, we process indexes in full every time lazy_vacuum is called,
 *		which makes index processing very inefficient when memory is in short
 *		supply.

	 * readahead and so be counterproductive. Also, skipping even a single
	 * page means that we can't update relfrozenxid, so we only want to do it
	 * if we can skip a goodly number of pages.
	 *
	 * When aggressive is set, we can't skip pages just because they are
	 * all-visible, but we can still skip pages that are all-frozen, since
	 * such pages do not need freezing and do not affect the value that we can
	 * safely set for relfrozenxid or relminmxid.
	 *
	 * Before entering the main loop, establish the invariant that
	 * next_unskippable_block is the next block number >= blkno that we can't
	 * skip based on the visibility map, either all-visible for a regular scan
	 * or all-frozen for an aggressive scan.  We set it to nblocks if there's
	 * no such block.  We also set up the skipping_blocks flag correctly at
	 * this stage.
	 *
	 * Note: The value returned by visibilitymap_get_status could be slightly
	 * out-of-date, since we make this test before reading the corresponding
	 * heap page or locking the buffer.  This is OK.  If we mistakenly think
	 * that the page is all-visible or all-frozen when in fact the flag's just
	 * been cleared, we might fail to vacuum the page.  It's easy to see that
	 * skipping a page when aggressive is not set is not a very big deal; we
	 * might leave some dead tuples lying around, but the next vacuum will
	 * find them.  But even when aggressive *is* set, it's still OK if we miss
	 * a page whose all-frozen marking has just been cleared.  Any new XIDs
	 * just added to that page are necessarily newer than the GlobalXmin we
	 * computed, so they'll have no effect on the value to which we can safely
	 * set relfrozenxid.  A similar argument applies for MXIDs and relminmxid.
	 *
	 * We will scan the table's last page, at least to the extent of
	 * determining whether it has tuples or not, even if it should be skipped
	 * according to the above rules; except when we've already determined that
	 * it's not worth trying to truncate the table.  This avoids having
	 * lazy_truncate_heap() take access-exclusive lock on the table to attempt
	 * a truncation that just fails immediately because there are tuples in
	 * the last page.  This is worth avoiding mainly because such a lock must
